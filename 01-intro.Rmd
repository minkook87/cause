### What is Causal Inference?

### Potential Outcome Framework, Regression, and Matching

  - In some special cases, conditioning may not work as it causes other backdoor paths to open. In this case, weighting methods can be used.

  - Selection on observables does not guarantee the balance of unobserved covariates.
  - Selection on observables strategies should be considered the last resort for causal inference, as it is quite challenging to account for unobserved variables by using only observed variables.
  - Control variables, matching, or weighting are still helpful in making randomized controlled trials or quasi-experiments more rigorous. It is more common to utilize control variables, matching, or weighting in tandem with other experimental methods, rather than in isolation.
  - *Ceteris Paribus* in the presence of control variables, matching, or weighting
    - The control group should be comparable to the treatment group in all aspects, except control variables, but the fact that they are treated.

### Quasi-Experiments

  - Quasi-experiment = Research Designs without random assignment
    - The only difference between RCT and quasi-experiment lies at the treatment assignment mechanism.
  - Quasi-experiment is a research design where a control group is comparable to the treatment, not randomly assigned, except the fact that they didn't receive the treatment.
    - Key Identification Assumption
      - Is the treatment assignment without random assignment as good as random?
      - How similar is the control group to the treatment group is the absence of the treatment?
  - Causation is defined as the difference in potential outcomes after the treatment.
    - Causal effect = (Actual outcome for treated if treated) – (Potential outcome for treated if not treated) = *Counterfactual*

  - What’s Your Research Design and Data Structure?

  - Difference-in-Differences
    - With panel data, DID approximates the counterfactual using its own prior and time trends of the control group.
    - For DID analysis, the parallel trend assumption (in the absence of treatment) must be hold. 
      - Basically, the parallel trend assumption is not verifiable, and what we can show is parallel pretrends. 
      - Matching methods might help to achieve the parallel trend assumption.

  - Synthetic Control
    - With panel data, SC approximates the counterfactual using a combination of the control group.
    - Synthetic control method is in line with difference-in-differences in that they approximate the counterfactual using untreated units in the control group.

  - Interrupted Time-Series Analysis
    - With pure time-series data, interrupted time-series analysis approximates the counterfactual using its own prior and time trends.
    - In the case of no control group, time-series forecasting models can be used to predict the counterfactual.
    - See **CausalImpact** R package

### Instrumental Variable and Regression Discontinuity

  - To interpret the regression in a causal manner, the treatment variable should not be correlated with the error term capturing all unobserved factors that could influence the outcome variable.
  
  - Instrumental variable (IV) is an instrument to separate the exogenous portion of the treatment variable from the endogenous portion (selection bias).
    - (1) The IVs should be correlated with the endogenous treatment variable (relevance).
    - (2) The IVs should not be correlated with the error term in the explanatory equation. 
      - Exclusion restriction: The IVs do not affect the outcome except through the treatment variable.
      - Exogeneity of IV: The IVs do not share any confounders with the outcome.

  - Regression Discontinuity (RD)
    - Regression discontinuity is to identify the local discontinuous jump on a running (assignment) variable.
    - The estimation of treatment effect in RD depends on extrapolation based on a running variable (dashed line).

### Causal Graph and Structural Causal Model

  - Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
    - Graph: A structure made from nodes and edges
    - Directed: Direction represents a causal relationship between nodes
    - Acyclic: No directed cycles

### Heterogeneous Treatment Effect Estimation Using Machine Learning - Application to Healthcare Data

  - Developing a drug: “from the new” vs. “recycling”

<center>![](figures/04.png)</center><br>  
  
  - What is Randomized clinicaltrials (RCTs)?
    - “Gold standard” for testing treatments in people
    - Test the treatment’s effectiveness by making a fair
comparison
    - Participants are divided by chance into separate groups
      - Treatment(s) group: receive a new treatment
      - Placebo group: receive standard treatment
    - Expensive, high failure rate, sometimes not safe
      - Emulate the RCTs using real-world observation!
  
  - Emulate RCTs using real-world observation (For existing drugs)
